Hello-World
===========

This is my first repository messing with GitHub

Finally ready to change up this README file. Luckily I branched off the master branch so these edits are not automatically on the master branch. Might merge soon though since the orginal Hello-world repo needs this README.


Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you make a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone pull in your contribution - aka merge them into their branch. GitHub’s Pull Request feature allows you to compare the content on two branches. The changes, additions and subtractions, are shown in green and red and called diffs (differences).

As soon as you make a change, you can open a Pull Request. People use Pull Requests to start a discussion about commits (code review) even before the code is finished. This way you can get feedback as you go or help when you’re stuck.
